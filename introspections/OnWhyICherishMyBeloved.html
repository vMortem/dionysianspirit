                        <p>
                            Love as life and life as love. I realized that I have always been intrigued by human beings. 
                            Being one, I can assure myself that it was true. It was because human beings are distinct from 
                            any other beings. Each of them is unique; every individual and existence are distinctive to each 
                            other. Even the ability to feel love and to love for another being, to me, is essentially unique. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Love, as a word itself, is universal. It is used in various contexts and situations. Why is that? 
                            Because love is eternal. Love is infinite and infinity lies beyond the dimension of limitations. 
                            Though, this does not mean that love is fully infinite. If it was then why do we feel it? Why do we
                            experience it? Why do we yearn for someone? Why do we desire for oneness?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was because love is also dynamic; it is harmonious. It moves freely, it embodies freedom, and it 
                            can go from any dimension: like the atoms and the molecules. It is mysterious as the experience itself; 
                            it is explainable yet still unexplainable. The number of words is not enough to define the mysteriousness
                            of love. The experiences are primarily ineffable. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Humans are limited; that they cannot fully express themselves. Humans can be both rational and irrational. 
                            I cherish my beloved for the reason that she is a human. For the reason 
                            that she is individually unique and authentic. She cannot be copied or duplicated because she is a living fragment; 
                            a fragment of all history.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The truth of my cherishment lies between my fragmented mind, body, and soul which unknowingly moves as a process. 
                            The truth of my cherishment is a process. It can be a thought, an action, or an expression. It can be an act of expression, 
                            an act of writing, a thought of beauty, an expression to beauty, a thought of art, an expression with words, an expression 
                            to uniqueness, an act of humanness. It can be a thought of: "She expresses herself with such graceful words", "She is the 
                            cure to my humanly illness", "She is bold and unpredictable", "Such details! I would have never thought of that", "She is so
                            enchanting with or without her glasses", "So gracefully unique and human".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The truth of my cherishment is an expression for oneness. It is to feel your sky, your sun, your moon, your stars, sky, wind,
                            and clouds. It is to feel your warmth; to measure your hands with mine; to be aware of embracing sides of our fingers; to whisper
                            a blurry voice; to measure your neck with kisses. Kisses that crave to quickly meet the softness of your skin, that needs a sudden
                            breath to continue, that starts from being slow and benign to being tense and in inconsistent direction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If love is life then I want to be a mind, body, and soul of love. If life is love then I want to be a lover of life. If love is art 
                            then I want to be an artist of love. If art is love then I want to be a lover of art. A lover of you.
                        </p>
