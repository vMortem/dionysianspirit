            <p>Welcome to my website! It was created on December 18, 2022 as a way to teach myself how to code better, but has since evolved into a creative output. While I love just messing around with CSS, I also post my writings here.</p>
            <p>If there is anything you like to ask or tell me, please don't hesitate to get in touch. You can reach me on my <a href= "https://neocities.org/site/offlinemagazine" target= "_blank">Neocities</a> profile.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
